## Notes

Posting new information and opening the camera app took a long time because of simple mistakes. For post I forgot to change 
the Post.class in getQuery(Post.class) and for the camera for somereason 

            if (intent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {
            // Start the image capture intent to take photo
            startActivityForResult(intent, CAPTURE_IMAGE_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE);

        }
  would not open in the camera so i added startActivityForResult(intent, CAPTURE_IMAGE_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE);
       outside of the if statment.
